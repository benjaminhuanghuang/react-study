## Types of Tests

• End-to-End: Spin up your app and simulate user behavior. Kind of like a robot performing a task in your app.
• Integration: Verify that multiple units work together.
• Unit: Verify the functionality of a single function/component.
• Static: Catch typos and errors while writing code.

## Setup

- React Testing Library: Provides virtual DOM for tests
- Jest: Test runner

# Implement jsx


If you're using the React 17+ automatic JSX runtime with a bundler like Webpack, Vite, or Rollup, 
the development build automatically references jsx-dev-runtime.ts instead of jsx-runtime.ts, like
```js
import {jsxDEV} from "/node_modules/.vite/deps/react_jsx-dev-runtime.js?v=0ed89e35";
let element = jsxDEV("h1", {
    children: [

    ]
});
```
